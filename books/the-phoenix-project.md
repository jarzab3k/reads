In the past, 
they’ve just pointed to a network folder and said, ‘Deploy that.’ There are 
newborn babies dropped off at church doorsteps with more operating 
instructions than what they’re giving us.

Half the company will grind to a halt if they go down, and the vendor went 
out of business decades ago! These things are so fragile that if you even 
look at them at the wrong time of day, they’ll crash and require all sorts 
of voodoo to get them to successfully reboot. 

“Eliyahu M. Goldratt, who 
created the Theory of Constraints, showed us how any improvements 
made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion. Astonishing, but 
true!

But like financial debt, 
the compounding interest costs grow over time. If an organization 
doesn’t pay down its technical debt, every calorie in the organization 
can be spent just paying interest, in the form of unplanned work.”

“Rother calls this the Improvement Kata,” he con-
tinues. “He used the word kata, because he understood that repetition 
creates habits, and habits are what enable mastery. Whether you’re talk-
ing about sports training, learning a musical instrument, or training in 
the Special Forces, nothing is more to mastery than practice and drills.

It feels like we have the initia-
tive and are attacking the problem, instead of the other way around.

Coso cube!?

“The longer the prod-
uct development cycle, the longer the company capital is locked up and 
not giving us a return

As Goldratt would say, you’ve deployed an 
amazing technology, but because you haven’t changed the way you work, 
you haven’t actually diminished a limitation.”

“For Phoenix, it takes us 
three or four weeks for new developers to get builds running on their 
machine, because we’ve never assembled the complete list of the gazil-
lion things you need installed in order for it to compile and run. But 
now all we have to do is check out the virtual machine that Brent and 
team built, and they’re all ready to go.”

For once, it won’t be just us staying up all night 
because something went really wrong. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. 
People are staying up all night because everything was going right.

While many of the DevOps patterns shown in this book require automa-
tion, DevOps also requires shared goals and shared pain throughout the 
IT value stream. This goes far beyond just automation.

Amazingly, the transformations are not 
primarily based on automation.
