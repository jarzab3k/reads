Design for manufacturability low cost high quality

Systems spend more time in operation than in development

Avoiding one time cost by incurring a recurring cost makes no sense

Team planned a phased rollout driven by features

Managing perception after incident is as important as managing incidents

Bugs may happen but must be survived

Integration points - try circuit breaker timeouts decoupling Middleware handshaking

Single point of failure

Chain reaction - bulkheads

Bulkheads on a ship?

Systems should run indefinitely without human intervention

Steady state = for every mechanism that accumulates resource some other mechanism must recycle it

Data purging

In memory caching speeds up application until it slows it down;)

Roll the logs

Check the resource availability at the start of a transaction

Healthcheck when lack of handshaking

HTTP healthcheck can be expensive

In your protocols you should use handshaking

Database integration is a pure evil

Many people means detailed planning and coordination

When releases are painful then they will not come out so often

Users care only about their own calendars
