Remember, getting started with
improvements is more important than getting finished with them.


MicroVMs vs Unikernels !?!

A rea‐
sonable approach is to plan for 10 times your current traffic and accept that
work will be needed to go further.

Capability-oriented architecture

Visualise your system as team activity / practice

Even good changes become bad news when people aren’t expecting them.

The opposite of the freewheeling Wild West antipattern was a military-style,
top-down, command-and-control approach. Worse yet, the approach created an insurgent “shadow IT”: groups or teams began running their own mini-IT organizations to get
things done, because their needs were not being met through official
channels.

All the technology in the world can’t fix
bad processes.

Many datacenters use an intrusion
prevention system (IPS) ??

Delegated identity management (DIM), federated identity management (FIM),
sharing, and synchronization are the most popular IAM patterns. 

Oauth 2.0, openidconnect

Always have a break-glass account

Game day = introduce failure in your system reuglarly, first in preprod. (Every 6 months)

What if we all approached outages with a “Hey, that might have been me!”
attitude?

work-as-imagined and work-as-done

Recognizing and
accepting differences helps business units coexist and adopt the cloud in har‐
mony instead of battling over standards.

People writing code should also deploy it, understand what the
implications are when running it in the cloud, and understand the mainte‐
nance effort that their code requires.

Automation software delivery pipelines, container orchestration and security
scanning, infrastructure as code, monitoring, alerting—all of this is available
almost for free to anybody. Software engineers working in the cloud should
flex their production operation muscles and embrace these tools as part of
their daily work. There are no excuses for not doing this in an era in which
the pace of delivery and speed of adaptability are key factors in the success or
failure of a company.

This is often called chopping wood and carrying water: unglamo‐
rous work to help the project and community.

It is hard to write good tests for bad code!

The greatest product you can deliver to your customers is the superpower.
The power-up. The Magic Moment! 

If the codebase is too complex or complicated to understand and refactor,
it’s definitely too complex or complicated to rewrite.

DevOps is meant to be development teams working with
operations teams, not just individuals in developer and operations roles
working together

If we are going to
do DevOps, it behooves us to know why we’re doing it, and not only how.

FinOps is an approach to managing and operating cloud spending by break‐
ing down the silos in engineering, finance, and procurement.

Provide real-time visibility on cloud spending for the consuming teams,
as it helps them make better decisions and understand the financial
implications of their cloud usage.

Total cost of ownership

General Data Protection Regula‐
tion (GDPR) should use compliance as code to automate compliance
verification.

As evidenced by DevOps Research & Assessment (DORA)
research, TDD is at the heart of velocity, success, and enjoyment of our
work. It cannot be underestimated or put off. If you’re an engineer, embrace
it, and if you’re a leader, champion its cause. It will pay dividends.

my response is that you are not taking away
your work; you are giving yourself time for more challenging and meaning‐
ful work.

DataOps

How do you define your recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point
objective (RPO)

Backoff with jitter 

A team
that integrates developer work less than once a day can’t be considered to be
practicing continuous integration, no matter how many fancy pipelines it
has in place.

Twenty years ago, Joel Spolsky wrote the classic blog post “Things You
Should Never Do, Part I. He talks about how rewriting code from scratch is
the single biggest mistake a developer can make. 

Where there are people, there are politics.

Cloud engineers need to understand these human aspects when making
decisions to reduce political friction from the decisions they make every day.

Taking your old “pile of
stuff” and pulling one lever of change simply results in a slightly updated pile
of stuff

The cloud service providers offer
training programs that teach employees how to build and run workloads in
the cloud, but what they don’t teach is how cloud is done within your organi‐
zation.

Supporting a system and empowering team members to support their system
aids understanding of what causes issues, provides insight into regularity of
recurring issues, and improves empathy and ownership—and quite right‐
fully sets everyone on the path of thinking in terms of consequences, and
thus systems thinking.

When a team aligns with the same outcome, we get better value and results.

Output vs outcome

Dare to Lead by Brené Brown (Random House, 2018) is a personal
favorite of mine for grappling with conflicts and complexity within an orga‐
nization.
