For any project attribute, it’s possible to measure that attribute in a way that’s superior
to not measuring it at all

If there’s no heartbeat, the project is dead. (about building daily)

Dale Carnegie’s How to Win
Friends and Influence People

Measure anything is better than do nothing

Against this backdrop, daily builds enforce discipline and keep pressure-cooker
projects on track

When you hear a tool vendor claim “This new tool will eliminate computer program-
ming,” run!

The smaller part of the job of programming is writing a program so that
the computer can read it; the larger part is writing it so that other humans can read it.

The bottom line
is that the details of a specific method of structuring a program are much less impor-
tant than the fact that the program is structured consistently.

until you’ve measured performance gains, you’re better off striving for
clarity and correctness first, performance second.

In well-written code, comments are the icing on the readability cake.

Performance is not a good reason to avoid commenting

The number of comments, however, will be a side
effect of the process itself. Rather than focusing on the number of comments, focus on
whether each comment is efficient.

Styles that are hard to maintain aren’t
maintained

s Kernighan and Plauger emphasize, “Don’t document bad code—
rewrite it” (1978

Coding conventions should
encourage good practices; heavy routine headers do the opposite.

follow the Principle of Proximity and put comments as close as possible to
the code they describe. They’re more likely to be maintained, and they’ll continue to
be worthwhile.

Personal character has received a rare degree of attention in software development.
Ever since Edsger Dijkstra’s landmark 1965 article, “Programming Considered as a
Human Activity,”

Your employer can’t force you to be a good programmer; a lot of times your employer
isn’t even in a position to judge whether you’re good. If you want to be great, you’re
responsible for making yourself great.

The purpose of many good programming practices is to reduce the load on your gray
cells

Conceptual Blockbusting
(2001).

: “Look. This is how much it’s
going to cost. I can’t say whether it’s worth this price to the company—that’s your job.
But I can tell you how long it takes to develop a piece of software—that’s my job. I can’t
‘negotiate’ how long it will take; that’s like negotiating how many feet are in a mile.
You can’t negotiate laws of nature. We can, however, negotiate other aspects of the
project that affect the schedule and then reestimate the schedule. We can eliminate
features, reduce performance, develop the project in increments, or use fewer people
and a longer schedule or more people and a shorter schedule.”

keep the person who has to modify your code in mind.
Programming is communicating with another programmer first and communicating
with the computer second.

Don’t waste your creativity on things that don’t matter. Establish conventions in non-
critical areas so that you can focus your creative energies in the places that count.

In general, attacking what Chapter 5 describes as “accidental difficulties” wher-
ever possible.

Dogmatic methodologies and high-quality software development don’t mix. Fill
your intellectual toolbox with programming alternatives, and improve your skill
at choosing the right tool for the job.
