This repo contains things that I've read lately.

It is supposed to be a list of all the things that I read (books, articles), saw (youtube talks) with some summary, so I can get beck here, when I forget why I read some book/article at all. 

There are three main files:
 books.md - just a plain list of books that I read in chronological order, here are also non-technical books (just to keep tracking)
 articles.md - articles that I read in chronological order (only technical)
 videos.md - videos that I've seen with their links (only technical)

Besides there is a summary dictionary where in each file I put my thoughts about the book that I made during reading. Some are just buzzy words that I should know or get to know, some are question that I would like to ask my self in the context of current work.

In the thougts.md I collect some sentences from colleauges or myself or authors that I find useful and that I find help me to guide my daily work. 

In the toread.md I collect things that I think I should see / read.
